## Introduction
This class will teach students about modern web development technologies, practices, and industry standards to better equip them for academic work, research, interviews, internships, and full-time employment. 

## What will be taught?
By the end of the course, students will be have a much more in-depth understanding of JavaScript as it pertains to many common software libraries used in web development. These libraries include (but are not limited to) React, Webpack, Node.js, NPM, Express, PostgreSQL, and Google App Engine. The exact technologies can shift from semester to semester as demands from students, and in the industry, evolve and change. What is in demand now may not be desired in two years from now. The primary technologies that this class is powered by can shift from semester to semester to reflect what employers are looking for.

Throughout this course, students will work as individuals and in groups to apply these skills to projects. These are both skills that are extremely important to employers: being able to function independently on assigned tasks, and being able to collaborate with different people on a wide variety of tasks. The idea is to closely resemble milestones and checkpoints in project development, which occur with one to many people. The course will culminate with students being able to showcase their semester-long project to each other, and to members of the Cornell Design & Tech Initiative project team.

## What are the prerequisites?
This course will be covering both client-facing and server-side technologies. INFO/CS 1300, or equivalent experience, is a pre-requisite.
